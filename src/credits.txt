This game is a simple terminal based Blackjack program written in C. 
It started as a basic blackjack calculator that was assigned to us as a 
25 minute “Dash” project at School 42 in Fremont, California. I spent 
a few days making it into the version you are currently playing. 
I implemented a basic betting system, but left out splits, doubles, 
and other features of Blackjack typically found in Casinos. Hope you enjoy!
